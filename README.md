# About Me
## My Interest

     My hobbies include cooking and challenging myself to learn things i find interesting.

    Cooking has been a passion of mine since I was young. Creating a dish from scratch and being able to feed others is very satisying to me.

    Challenging myself to create a new dish or learning new technology has always been apart of my personality.
